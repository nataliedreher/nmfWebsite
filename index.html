                        Hi there! I`m N.M. your friendly neighborhood MM romance author. I`m just a quirky, nerdy girl
                        who finds it easier to speak through the mouths of fictional men than to navigate small talk in
                        the real world. In real life, I often bumble through conversation using song lyrics and movie
                        quotes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before I was a novelist, I was a poet and that love of language shines through every page I
                        write. My stories are steeped in emotion and imagery with characters who feel like real people
                        you might pass on the street (and secretly wish you could follow home).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The men you`re most often going to see from my books are tender, if sometimes messy, but
                        protective and soft where it counts. They`re wholesome sweethearts with gentle souls and hidden
                        scars.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I`m not writing slow-burn romance or arguing with my characters at 2 a.m. because they`ve
                        hijacked the plot, you can find me reading, adventuring, competing, traveling, or passionately
                        yelling at a sports game. I survive on tea and thrive on anything outdoorsy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let`s fall in love, one chapter at a time.

                    <strong>~Ezra~</strong>
                    <p>
                        When bartender Ezra first meets Micah under the pulsing lights of a Seattle nightclub, it feels
                        like gravity shifts. Their chemistry is electric, but just as quickly, Micah disappears into the
                        night, leaving Ezra with nothing but the memory of a night that never got to be more. Four
                        months later, fate brings them back together, and Ezra takes the chance he never thought he'd
                        get.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As their second chance transforms, Ezra finds himself drawn deeper, becoming a grounding force
                        in a reality he doesn`t fully understand but is determined to navigate.
                    </p>
                    <strong>~Micah~</strong>
                    <p>
                        Micah has spent years believing he`s too much—too chaotic, too broken—for love. But Ezra sees
                        past the walls he`s built, offering patience, steadiness, and affection he isn`t used to and
                        still questions that he`s worthy of. As their bond deepens, Micah dares to hope for a future
                        where he isn` left behind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But when the weight of reality catches up to them they both must decide if love is enough to
                        hold them through the storm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Be Your Gravity is a tender, low-angst, hurt/comfort MM contemporary romance told in alternating
                        perspectives. It's a story about unconditional love, acceptance, and finding beauty in the
                        messy, complicated places we`d rather hide and realizing we`re still worthy of being loved
                        there. Along the way, expect bantering friends, a healthy dose of whimsy, terrible puns, and the
                        kind of intimacy that makes space for both laughter and tears. An HEA is guaranteed.
